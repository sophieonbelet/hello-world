        <h2>Designing icons isn’t hard to do. But it is, apparently, hard to do right. There are a lot of things to keep
          in mind when creating a large set of icons.
        </h2>
      </p>
      <p>But before we get into the details of what and how, we should ﬁrst talk about what icons are. Icons are small
        abstract shapes that represent an idea. In UI design they can be used to make the interface easier to read. An
        icon is something to interact with. An intuitive visual that’s understandable through all cultures and
        languages. If used correctly, with a consistent icon set you can give a feeling of quality in your interface, to
        signal to your user that you’re a professional who knows what they’re doing
      </p>
      <p>Icons are a part of the UI. They should blend in, be actionable and easily understood at small sizes. Often
        clients will request an ‘icon’ that’s used more to just have a fun visual next to, say, a <u>USP*</u>. These
        usually shouldn’t be icons, they’re ‘spot illustrations’ and can be richer in visual style than regular icons.

        <q>Before you know it you have a horrible mishmash of differently styled icons in your interface

      <p>
        Of course you could just download an icon pack from the internet and be done with it. Those packs are often
        missing some icons you might need for your speciﬁc use and you’ll end up downloading more icon packs to ﬁll up
        the missing icons. Those icons have a different style from the ﬁrst pack though. And before you know it you have
        a horrible mishmash of differently styled icons in your interface. Those packs are also not very unique and
        don’t always ﬁt with the brand identity of your client. An icon set designed with airport wayﬁnding in mind
        would feel completely out of place at a Chinese supermarket for example.
      </p>
      <p>Icon design is very much a precise job. Unlike web/interface design, there’s no front-end developer who’ll ﬁx
        your smaller mistakes and inconsistencies later on. You have to make sure everything is perfect. From the stroke
        weights and corner radiuses to a consistent perspective and overall weight of the icons themselves.
      </p>
      <p>Should this even be an icon Before you start designing any icon you should always ask yourself if it should
        even be an icon. What is it going to be used for? In what context, Who’s the target audience?
      </p>
      <p>If the icon is going to be used to just add an image to some text, it should probably not be an icon. A spot
        illustration would be more appropriate. When designing a set of icons that start to look more and more the same,
        for example different types of media (CD, DVD, Blu-ray), you should probably not try to create different icons
        for everything. It’s okay to use the same icon for different cases.

      </p>
      <p>Deﬁne the style When designing icons for a client, you’ll want the icons to ﬁt in with the brand. For this you
        can look at a couple different things. The typography or the logo for example. Does it have sharp corners or is
        it more rounded, how thick are the strokes. The brand colours. Is it just one colour, monochrome, multiple
        colours or does it use transparency? Or if that’s not enough, have a look at the brand promise or the core
        values. What’s the tone of voice? Is it loud, soft, friendly, pure business, etc? This will all have impact on
        the style of the icon.
      </p>
      <p>Put it on a grid To make sure all your icons have the same weight and feel like they’re from the same family of
        icons you should use an icon grid. These consist of a couple of rectangles and circles. You can see these as
        bounding boxes. The amount of pixels within each shape is somewhat the same. Stay within these shapes and your
        icons will feel like they all have the same weight. Google has a great icon grid for their Android/Material
        Design icons.
      </p>
      <p>Outlines or solid When deciding between outline or solid icons always look at the bigger picture ﬁrst. Will it
        feel at home within the design. Are outline icons heavy enough? Are solid icons too heavy?
      </p>
      <p>Also consider that not all shapes work as one or the other. Outline icons tend to get really complex really
        fast and loose their recognisability and meaning in an interface. The same goes for solid icons. Not all icons
        feel solid. A smartphone or laptop icon might look like outline icons because of their screens.
      </p>
      <p>Corners Are all icons going to have hard corners, or are they all going to have a corner radius? It’s easy to
        lose this consistency in larger icon sets. Hard corners don’t always work on all icons and the same goes for
        rounded corners. Try to have a good rational behind the usage. For instance, only use rounded corners on icons
        that represent physical objects that are mostly rounded or organic shapes that wouldn’t be recognisable with
        hard corners. Just be consistent. Don’t use different radiuses for every icon.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Conclusion Start on paper, think about the icon, should it even be an icon. What size is the icon going to be
        used at. Put it on a grid. Be consistent in your strokes, corners, the use of outlines, solids and 2D or 3D. And
        please don’t ever use free social media icon packs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Keeping all this in mind, designing a consistent icon set shouldn’t be all that hard.</p>

      The unique selling proposition (USP) or unique selling point is a marketing concept ﬁrst proposed as a theory to
      explain a pattern in successful advertising campaigns of the early 1940s. The USP states that such campaigns made
      unique propositions to customers that convinced them to switch brands.
